  <p>I&#8217;m Lisa, a Software Apprentice at 8th Light in Chicago. I have a passion for crafting code to bring ideas to life. I&#8217;m actively working to expand my development skillset and am currently writing an abundance of Ruby. When I&#8217;m not coding, you can find me running, reading, checking out the Chicago brunch scene, or cheering on the Michigan Wolverines.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/02/12/word-wrap-kata-in-ruby/">Word Wrap Kata in Ruby</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been working through the <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/10/craftsman-62-dark-path.html">Word Wrap Kata</a>, writing it in Ruby. Since <a href="http://thecleancoder.blogspot.com/2010/10/craftsman-62-dark-path.html">Uncle Bob&rsquo;s post</a> walks through the kata in Java, I thought I&rsquo;d write a post detailing an implementation in Ruby.</p>




<h3>The General Concept</h3>




<p>The idea behind this kata is to write a method that will wrap a string of text according to a specified line length/width. The wrap method will take a string and line length as parameters. It must return the string with appropriate line breaks, ensuring no line is longer than the specified line length. The concept is similar to that of a word processor (i.e. Microsoft Word). Uncle Bob uses TDD to demonstrate the benefit of taking small steps when writing code. If the step you are trying to take in your code seems more like a leap, there is likely a simpler step that could (and should) be taken.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/02/02/optimizing-solution-to-project-euler-problem-12/">Optimizing Solution to Project Euler Problem 12</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>While working on the Project Euler problems, I came across one (Problem 12) that was taking a very long time to compute. In this blog post, I will go through the initial steps I took to solve the problem, followed by the steps I took to optimize the solution. Problem 12 reads:</p>




<p>The sequence of triangular numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangular number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, &hellip;
Let us list the factors of the first seven triangular numbers:<br>
 1: 1<br>
 3: 1,3<br>
 6: 1,2,3,6<br>
10: 1,2,5,10<br>
15: 1,3,5,15<br>
21: 1,3,7,21<br>
28: 1,2,4,7,14,28<br>
We can see that 28 is the first triangular number to have over five divisors.
What is the value of the first triangular number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/01/22/rubys-yield-keyword/">Ruby&#8217;s Yield Keyword</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>This week I have been working on solving <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems with Ruby. Project Euler is a website containing mathematical problems that require a computer to solve them. Many of the problems have common themes such as identifying prime numbers or Fibonacci terms. My mentor recommended placing code pertaining to these common themes in modules so the code can be reused by including the module in the problems that require it.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/01/15/the-code-kata-practice-for-programmers/">The Code Kata: Practice for Programmers</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I wrote a <a href="http://www.lisahamm.com/blog/2015/01/09/the-bowling-game-kata/">blog post</a> last week about my experience pairing with my mentor on the Bowling Game Kata. I have continued to work on this kata over the last week and now have more insight into why developers do these. The word “kata” is a Japanese word for “form.” A kata is a karate exercise that is continuously repeated with the intent of making little improvements with each repetition. This concept has been brought into the software development world and is commonly referred to as a Code Kata, which is essentially a practice session for the programmer. Just as an athlete must practice her sport and a musician must practice his instrument, a developer also needs to practice her craft. Each code kata is designed to be a short exercise of which is completed daily for two weeks. The daily practice is designed to ingrain patterns into one’s mind while honing development skills.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/01/13/useful-keyboard-shortcuts/">Useful Keyboard Shortcuts</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I’ve been working on improving the time it takes me to complete the Bowling Game Kata. One thing that has been helpful with this is learning keyboard shortcuts that facilitate easy movement throughout the text editor. I am currently coding in Sublime Text 2 on a MacBook. I found <a href="http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/keyboard_shortcuts_osx.html">this webpage</a> that lists several shortcuts. So far, the most useful have been:</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2015/01/09/the-bowling-game-kata/">The Bowling Game Kata</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Yesterday I sat down with my 8th Light mentor, Doug, and paired on the <a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata">Bowling Game Kata</a> and wrote it in Ruby. The general concept is to write a program capable of scoring a game of bowling and to use test driven development (TDD) in order to do so. A game of bowling is made up of 10 frames in which a player has two opportunities to knock down 10 pins. The player earns a score equal to the number of pins knocked down in each frame, but also has the opportunity to earn additional points for a spare (whatever is earned in the next roll is added to the 10 points in the frame) and a strike (points earned from the following two rolls are added to the 10 points in the frame).</p>
